        <p>Kenya is a beautiful and diverse country located in East Africa, known for its stunning landscapes, rich
            wildlife, and vibrant culture. From the iconic savannahs of the Maasai Mara to the snow-capped peak of Mount
            Kenya and the white sandy beaches along the Indian Ocean coast, Kenya offers breathtaking natural beauty. It
            is home to over 40 ethnic groups, each with its own unique traditions, languages, and cuisines, making the
            country a melting pot of cultures. Nairobi, the capital, is a bustling hub of business and innovation, while
            rural areas showcase Kenya’s deep-rooted heritage and connection to nature. Kenya is also celebrated
            globally for its world-class athletes, particularly in long-distance running, and its commitment to
            conservation and tourism.</p>
